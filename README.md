# Bird Sound Detection
## Description
In this repo, I build a simple classification network to solve the task of Bird Sound Detection (determine whether bird sound is contained in audio file or not). Additionally, I experiment some audio features on this task to see which one fit well on this challenge. The code is implemented in Tensorflow.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this repo is __Warblr__. You can also look for other datasets in this [link](https://dagshub.com/kingabzpro/Bird-Audio-Detection-challenge).
